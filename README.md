# Y3-Robotics
Robotics module to explore and implement different algorithms for automatic robotic navigation

Due to COVID restrictions, this group project was not possible to be done in person with physical robots. Therefore we instead had to work remotely and simulate the robot in a Gazebo environment.

For our project, we focused on using deep learning to teach the robot to autonomously navigate any environment. We used the DQN reinforcment learning model to teach the robot what to avoid and what to move towards.

This module used Python and I recieved a 1st for it.
